    {characteristic: 'Shell Construction', percentage: 20, explanation: 'Shell construction significantly influences the frequency response of the drum. Thicker shells tend to emphasize lower frequencies and can dampen higher frequencies, leading to a more focused sound. Thinner shells resonate more, producing a broader range of frequencies and a brighter tonal profile.'},
    {characteristic: 'Bearing Edge', percentage: 12, explanation: 'The angle and sharpness of the bearing edge directly affect the harmonic frequencies produced by the drum. Sharper edges promote higher frequencies and more defined overtones, while rounder edges soften the high-end frequencies and enhance mid-range warmth.'},
    {characteristic: 'Depth', percentage: 12, explanation: 'Drum depth plays a role in the frequency balance, especially the low and mid-range frequencies. Shallow drums tend to focus on higher frequencies, providing clear projection, while deeper drums emphasize low-end warmth and extended sustain in the lower frequencies.'},
    {characteristic: 'Drumhead Type', percentage: 12, explanation: 'The drumhead type (coated, clear, hybrid) affects the tonal balance by influencing the response of mid and high frequencies. Coated heads soften high-end overtones and introduce warmth, while clear heads enhance high frequencies, resulting in sharper and brighter tones.'},
    {characteristic: 'Wood Species', percentage: 12, explanation: 'The wood species used for the shell significantly shapes the frequency spectrum. Hardwoods like maple accentuate higher frequencies and brightness, while softer woods like mahogany produce more low-end emphasis and a warmer tonal range.'},
    {characteristic: 'Drumhead Tension', percentage: 8, explanation: 'Drumhead tension impacts the overall frequency response, particularly affecting the pitch and sustain of high frequencies. Higher tension tightens the head, enhancing high frequencies, while lower tension produces a warmer sound with stronger resonance in the low-mid frequencies.'},
    {characteristic: 'Shell Thickness', percentage: 8, explanation: 'Thicker shells emphasize lower frequencies and reduce sustain, contributing to a focused and tight sound. Thinner shells resonate more freely, enhancing mid and high frequencies and giving the drum a broader tonal response.'},
    {characteristic: 'Hardware Type', percentage: 5, explanation: 'The type of hardware used on a drum, such as lugs and tension rods, can subtly influence frequency response. Heavier hardware tends to enhance sustain and low-end frequencies, while lighter hardware allows for more resonant tones, slightly emphasizing the high-end frequencies.'},
    {characteristic: 'Hoop Type', percentage: 5, explanation: 'Different hoop types, such as die-cast or triple-flanged, affect the frequency distribution. Die-cast hoops tend to focus on higher frequencies with a tighter sound, while triple-flanged hoops provide more resonance, emphasizing lower-mid frequencies and contributing to a warmer tonal response.'},
    {characteristic: 'Width', percentage: 4, explanation: 'Drum width influences the tonal response, especially in the low and mid frequencies. A wider drum will accentuate lower frequencies, producing more warmth, while a narrower drum produces a more focused sound with clearer mid-range and higher frequencies.'},
    {characteristic: 'Finish Type', percentage: 2, explanation: 'Finish type has a minimal but subtle impact on frequency response. Glossy finishes tend to enhance high frequencies by reflecting sound waves, increasing brightness. Matte finishes absorb some of the higher frequencies, resulting in a softer, warmer tonal profile.'}
