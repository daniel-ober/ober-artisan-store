const projectionValues = [
  { characteristic: 'Shell Construction', percentage: 32, explanation: 'Shell construction is a primary factor affecting projection due to how the material and construction type influence the drum’s resonance and sound transmission. Harder woods like maple or birch create a louder and more projecting sound.' },
  { characteristic: 'Depth', percentage: 22, explanation: 'Deeper drums project sound more effectively, providing a fuller, louder sound due to increased air volume and the longer path for sound waves to travel.' },
  { characteristic: 'Wood Species', percentage: 15, explanation: 'Denser woods, such as maple and birch, allow for better projection. The denser material vibrates more efficiently, transferring more energy from the drumhead to the air.' },
  { characteristic: 'Shell Thickness', percentage: 12, explanation: 'Thicker shells add stability and reinforcement to the overall structure, affecting how the drumhead energy is transferred, impacting projection.' },
  { characteristic: 'Width', percentage: 9, explanation: 'Larger diameter drums are inherently louder and have more potential to project sound due to their greater vibrating surface area.' },
  { characteristic: 'Bearing Edge', percentage: 4, explanation: 'Sharper bearing edges can improve projection by providing a more focused sound, while rounder edges can soften the tone and reduce projection.' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Tension', percentage: 3, explanation: 'Higher tension drumheads tend to project sound more effectively, producing a clearer, more focused tone.' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Type', percentage: 2, explanation: 'The drumhead affects the amount of projection. Thinner drumheads such as single-ply heads generally allow for better projection.' },
  { characteristic: 'Hoop Type', percentage: 1, explanation: 'Hoops impact the drum’s projection by how they interact with the shell, but the effect is minimal compared to shell construction or depth.' },
  { characteristic: 'Finish Type', percentage: 0.5, explanation: 'The finish type can affect the tonal characteristics slightly, but it has minimal impact on overall projection.' },
  { characteristic: 'Hardware Type', percentage: 0.5, explanation: 'Hardware, including lugs and tension rods, generally does not have a significant impact on projection, though lighter hardware may help maximize it.' },
