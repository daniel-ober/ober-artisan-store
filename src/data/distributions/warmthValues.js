  { characteristic: 'Wood Species', percentage: 32, explanation: 'Softer woods like mahogany and maple give drums a warmer tone due to their ability to resonate more smoothly without harsh overtones. [Source](https://www.drumfinder.com/blog/importance-of-drum-wood-species/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Shell Construction', percentage: 20, explanation: 'The type of shell construction affects warmth through how it absorbs and projects sound. Multi-ply shells often produce warmer, more focused tones. [Source](https://www.drumfinder.com/blog/importance-of-shell-construction/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Shell Thickness', percentage: 14, explanation: 'Thicker shells help reduce harshness and add warmth to the sound by allowing for better tone control. [Source](https://www.drumfactorydirect.com/blog/how-thick-should-your-drum-shells-be/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Type', percentage: 10, explanation: 'Coated heads are often associated with warmer tones compared to clear heads. Coating softens the sound and reduces brightness. [Source](https://www.drumhead.com/blog/clear-vs-coated-drumheads/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Tension', percentage: 8, explanation: 'Lower tension generally helps produce warmer tones by reducing high-frequency overtones. [Source](https://www.drumhead.com/blog/choosing-the-right-drumhead-thickness/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Bearing Edge', percentage: 6, explanation: 'Rounded bearing edges contribute to a smoother, warmer tone by allowing for more even contact with the drumhead. [Source](https://www.drumsociety.com/blog/bearing-edges-and-how-they-affect-sound)' },
  { characteristic: 'Depth', percentage: 6, explanation: 'Deeper drums often produce more warmth due to their increased air volume and resonance. [Source](https://drumhead.com/what-importance-drum-depth/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Finish Type', percentage: 4, explanation: 'Matte finishes contribute slightly to warmth by creating a smoother surface that reduces unwanted frequencies. [Source](https://www.drumhead.com/blog/drum-finish-and-its-effects-on-sound/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Hoop Type', percentage: 4, explanation: 'Wood hoops provide a warmer, rounder tone compared to metal hoops, which can add more brightness. [Source](https://www.drumfinder.com/blog/drum-hoop-types/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Width', percentage: 3, explanation: 'Larger diameter drums often produce warmer tones due to their increased air volume. [Source](https://www.drummerworld.com/forums/index.php?threads/drum-sizes-for-sound-and-projection.91567/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Hardware Type', percentage: 2, explanation: 'Hardware generally has minimal effect on warmth, though lighter hardware can slightly enhance resonance. [Source](https://www.drumfactorydirect.com/blog/choosing-drums-hardware-impacts-sound/)' },
