const warmthValues = [
  { characteristic: 'Wood Species', percentage: 32, explanation: 'Softer woods like mahogany and maple give drums a warmer tone due to their ability to resonate more smoothly without harsh overtones.' },
  { characteristic: 'Shell Construction', percentage: 20, explanation: 'The type of shell construction affects warmth through how it absorbs and projects sound. Multi-ply shells often produce warmer, more focused tones.' },
  { characteristic: 'Shell Thickness', percentage: 14, explanation: 'Thicker shells help reduce harshness and add warmth to the sound by allowing for better tone control.' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Type', percentage: 10, explanation: 'Coated heads are often associated with warmer tones compared to clear heads. Coating softens the sound and reduces brightness.' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Tension', percentage: 6, explanation: 'Lower tension helps produce warmer tones by reducing high-frequency overtones but is not the primary factor.' },
  { characteristic: 'Bearing Edge', percentage: 6, explanation: 'Rounded bearing edges contribute to a smoother, warmer tone by allowing for more even contact with the drumhead.' },
  { characteristic: 'Depth', percentage: 8, explanation: 'Deeper drums often produce more warmth due to their increased air volume and resonance.' },
  { characteristic: 'Finish Type', percentage: 4, explanation: 'Matte finishes contribute slightly to warmth by creating a smoother surface that reduces unwanted frequencies.' },
  { characteristic: 'Hoop Type', percentage: 4, explanation: 'Wood hoops provide a warmer, rounder tone compared to metal hoops, which can add more brightness.' },
  { characteristic: 'Width', percentage: 3, explanation: 'Larger diameter drums often produce warmer tones due to their increased air volume.' },
  { characteristic: 'Hardware Type', percentage: 2, explanation: 'Hardware generally has minimal effect on warmth, though lighter hardware can slightly enhance resonance.' },
