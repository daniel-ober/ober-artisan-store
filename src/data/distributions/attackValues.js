  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Tension', percentage: 20, explanation: 'Higher tension results in a sharper, quicker attack, while lower tension gives a more open and less immediate response. [Source](https://www.drumhead.com/blog/choosing-the-right-drumhead-thickness/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Drumhead Type', percentage: 18, explanation: 'Single-ply heads provide a snappier attack compared to double-ply heads, which soften the initial impact. Clear heads also emphasize attack more than coated heads. [Source](https://www.drumhead.com/blog/clear-vs-coated-drumheads/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Shell Construction', percentage: 16, explanation: 'Harder materials such as maple and birch produce a sharper and more immediate attack. The construction affects how energy from the strike is transferred to the shell. [Source](https://www.moderndrummer.com/2016/09/the-science-of-drums-sound-characteristics/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Bearing Edge', percentage: 14, explanation: 'Sharper bearing edges emphasize the attack by allowing for a more focused and articulate sound, while rounder edges produce a softer attack. [Source](https://www.drumsociety.com/blog/bearing-edges-and-how-they-affect-sound)' },
  { characteristic: 'Hoop Type', percentage: 9, explanation: 'Die-cast hoops tend to focus the energy from the strike into a more punchy, direct attack, while triple-flanged hoops offer a slightly softer response. [Source](https://www.moderndrummer.com/2015/03/need-know-counterhoops/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Wood Species', percentage: 8, explanation: 'Hardwoods like oak or maple deliver a more focused and quick attack due to their density and energy transfer properties. Softer woods provide a slightly more muted attack. [Source](https://www.drumfinder.com/blog/importance-of-drum-wood-species/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Depth', percentage: 6, explanation: 'Shallower drums produce a more focused and snappy attack, while deeper drums soften the attack and add more resonance. [Source](https://drumhead.com/what-importance-drum-depth/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Hardware Type', percentage: 3, explanation: 'The type of hardware, like lugs and tension rods, can slightly influence the drum’s attack by affecting the overall resonance, though this is a minor factor. [Source](https://www.drumfactorydirect.com/blog/choosing-drums-hardware-impacts-sound/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Width', percentage: 3, explanation: 'Smaller diameter drums often result in a sharper, more focused attack, as opposed to larger drums, which have a broader tone and softer attack. [Source](https://www.drumfinder.com/blog/impact-of-drum-sizes-on-sound/)' },
  { characteristic: 'Environmental Factors', percentage: 2, explanation: 'Environmental factors like temperature and humidity have a negligible effect on attack compared to other factors. [Source](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/how-environment-affects-sound)' },
  { characteristic: 'Finish Type', percentage: 2, explanation: 'Gloss finishes can reflect higher frequencies, slightly emphasizing the initial strike and making the attack feel sharper. Matte finishes have a minimal effect. [Source](https://www.drumhead.com/blog/drum-finish-and-its-effects-on-sound/)' },
