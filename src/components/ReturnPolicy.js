      <h2>1. Handcrafted Drums</h2>
      <p>
        Each of our handcrafted drums is custom-made with meticulous care. Because of the unique and personalized nature of these items, returns are limited to the following circumstances:
        <br />
        <strong>Damaged or Defective Items:</strong> If your drum arrives damaged or defective, you must contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of receiving the item. We will work with you to either repair or replace the drum. Please provide photographic evidence of the damage for a swift resolution.
        <br />
        <strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Due to the custom craftsmanship involved, returns or refunds for reasons other than damage or defect will not be accepted.
        <br />
        <strong>Repairs and Adjustments:</strong> If adjustments are needed after delivery, we offer repair services at an additional cost. Please contact us for details.
